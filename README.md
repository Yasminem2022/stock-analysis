#An Analysis of Green Stocks
Performing an analysis on green energy stock data to determine which to invest in, and refactoring code to run quicker.

#Results
##Original Code
In 2017, almost all of the green stocks had a positive return. However, one stock, TERP had a negative return percentage of -7.2%.

In 2018, only two stocks continued to do well. They were ENPH with a return percentage of 81.9%, and RUN with a return percentage of 84%.

##Refactored Code
With the original code it took 1.07 seconds to run 2017, and 1.08 seconds for 2018 to run.

However, with the refactored code, it took .16 seconds for 2017 to run and 0.15 seconds for 2018 to run.

#Summary
1.	An advantage of refactoring code is the potential for shortening the execution time. Another advantage is that refactoring makes your code easier to understand. A disadvantage of refactoring code is the possibility of creating a bug that wasn’t there before. Another disadvantage may be the long process of figuring out what could make your code more efficient.
2.	Refactoring my code shortened my execution time by more than half. Also, by refactoring my code, I was able to better understand the logic of what I was doing. However, I did end up creating a lot of bugs that took a lot of time to debug. Fortunately, the instructions kept me from encountering the last disadvantage of figuring out what I needed to do. I can see how that could be a problem in the future when I’m doing it on my own.
